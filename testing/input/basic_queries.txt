# ==========================================
# PROJECT FRIDAY - COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM TEST
# Scope: Jira, Slack, Calendar, Orchestration
# ==========================================

# 1. SYSTEM HEALTH CHECK
# ----------------------
What agents are currently loaded and available?
What is my configured timezone?
My email is h.sujan2004@gmail.com

# 2. JIRA AGENT TEST (Lifecycle)
# ------------------------------
# Create a new issue
Create a Jira bug in project KAN with summary "Mobile app crashes on startup" and description "Happens on iOS 16 devices during splash screen." priority High.

# Verify creation and context retention
What is the key of the Jira issue I just created?

# Update the issue
Assign that issue to me and add a comment saying "I have reproduced this on the simulator."

# 3. GOOGLE CALENDAR AGENT TEST
# -----------------------------
# Check availability (Read)
What meetings do I have scheduled for tomorrow?

# Schedule an event (Write)
Schedule a "Mobile Crash Debugging" session for tomorrow at 2pm for 1 hour if its clashing, schedule it for 1 hour before it .

# 4. SLACK AGENT TEST
# -------------------
# Send a direct notification
Send a message to #dev-opps saying "I'm investigating the iOS crash report (KAN-123)."

# 5. COMPLEX MULTI-AGENT WORKFLOW
# -------------------------------
# This tests the Orchestrator's ability to break down tasks and pass context (SharedContext)
# It requires: Calendar (check time) -> Jira (create task) -> Slack (notify with details)

Check my calendar for Friday morning. If I'm free at 10am, create a Jira task for "Weekly Sync" and notify the #dev-opps channel that the meeting is set for that time with the Jira ticket linked.
